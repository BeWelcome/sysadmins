Most folks on here know each other well in the real world. If in doubt, assume you're reading sarcasm, tongue in cheek, or otherwise frivolous speech. We're all friends here, having fun, don't mistake the light hearted tone for a lack of seriousness in the work, and most of all, please take it all with a pinch of salt, if it sounds in any way offensive, we're probably not serious. Think British humour. Google Ricky Jervais and laugh till you hurt.
